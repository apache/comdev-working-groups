# Website Working Group

This working group is an informal group of people who work on
maintaining, and improving, the [Apache Community Development
website](https://community.apache.org/).

This includes, but is not limited to:

* Long-term maintenance of the ComDev website. This involves regular audits, implementing metrics, and perhaps other things
* Reorg - this is a short-term task that I’ve been just doing on my own, which ensures it will never get done, and if it did, there may be some disagreement about how I did it.
* Deduplication - work closely with [VP, Marketing and Publicity](https://www.apache.org/press/) to figure out the *right* place for certain information; work through the policy/best-practice dichotomy and ensure that we are *not* duplicating policy docs; Work on content on [www.a.o](https://www.apache.org/) that is closely related to content on community.a.o - which one is authoritative? Ensure that we don’t duplicate, contradict, or confuse.
* Coordinate links and explanations with [Incubator documentation](https://incubator.apache.org/); we should ensure podlings can easily meet TLP expectations, and don't have duplicate or different content in the incubator (except where needed by process).

See also the [proposal for the creation of this
group](https://lists.apache.org/thread/wj1prnm95cy0rlvjqgcq15rt2r28wyqg).

## Website Sources & Tools

* Infra has an overview of [common site building tools at ASF](https://infra.apache.org/project-site.html)
* Comdev's community.a.o comes from [apache/comdev-site Github
repository](https://github.com/apache/comdev-site) using Hugo.
* www.apache.org website comes from [apache/www-site](https://github.com/apache/www-site/) using Pelican and some custom data sources.
* Incubator website comes from [apache/incubator](https://github.com/apache/incubator) and uses JBake and some custom clutch scripts.
* Infra's handy [list of all ASF project website sources](https://infra-reports.apache.org/#sitesource).
