# Writing New Documents

Questions to ask, and guidelines to follow, when you are writing a new
document on this, or any other website.

## Where does it go?

This includes both the site (www.a.o, community.a.o, etc) and the actual
URL. URLs should be guessable, and should mean the same thing on
different sites. Proposing and encouraging standard URLs (/about,
/community, /mission, and so on) makes the audience's experience easier.

## What document(s) does it augment?

Where does this document fit in the overall story that the website
tells? Where does it fit in a reader's path through the website?
Identify those branching points, and link to and from them, to ensure an
easy path to and from related information.

## What document(s) does it obsolete?

By "obsolete" we don't only mean replace, but also documents that now
contain duplicated information.

Remove the sections that are now obsolete (or, in extreme cases, the
entire document) and link to the new document.

A special case here is that some documents are canonical, and can not,
or should not, be modified. (e.g., the bylaws document, or policy
documents) In those cases, modify your document to eliminate duplication
of information, unless the duplication is intentional. (e.g., different
framing, format, or medium.)

## Who needs to know or approve?

Is there someone who needs to know about your new document before you
publish it? This includes subject matter experts, or people who have
written "competing" documents. Talk to these people individually to get
their feedback, edits, and buy-in, before taking it to a larger audience
or mailing list. This will avoid awkward situations where someone feels
that they should have been consulted.
