# I want to contribute to Apache Foo

## Question

The question, often sent to a specific project's dev list, typically
looks like "I want to contribute to Apache Foo but I don't know where to
get started."

These messages are often ignored, or answered with unhelpful "just start
doing stuff!!" messages that are well intentioned, but ultimately don't
give the necessary information to get started.

## Answer

Welcome aboard, [NAME]

As with any open source project, the way to get involved is to find your 
spot and just start doing it. Is there any particular aspect of [PROJECT]
where you’re particularly interested in getting involved?

I’d encourage you to have a look at the open issues - [LINK] - and see if
one of them strikes your interest.

I’d also encourage you to have a look at the code repo - [LINK].
Perhaps review some of the pull requests - that’s a great way to get more
familiar with the code, and also what kinds of issues people are
encountering with it.

Those two things are typically the best two ways to familiarize yourself
with the code, and to start doing useful things that will earn trust in
the community.

Finally, I would encourage you to subscribe to the dev and user lists
[LINKS] - and see what people are talking about. Feel free to jump in
and answer questions when you're able to do so, as this is a great way
to deepen your own understanding of the project, and the issues that
people encounter when using it.

As always, please feel free to ask further questions on the mailing
lists.
