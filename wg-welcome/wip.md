# Work in Progress

Here's some of what we're working on

## Boilerplate answers

We get at least one "how do I get involved?" email every week. The
responses to these messages vary from helpful to "go figure it out on
your own".

Let's craft some standard boilerplate answers that point people towards
useful resources, good advice, and helpful people. And then let's figure
out some process so that they get sent consistently. See ./templates/
for some drafts.
