# Social Media Working Group (Proposed)

Use social media to promote Apache communities

## Status

This WG is just an IDEA. Please come join the conversation about how we
might actually do this work, and what work we should do.

## What

Use the @apachecommunity Twitter account, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other
social media outlets to promote Apache communities.

Work with projects to better facilitate their own social media outlets,
and to share Foundation-wide messaging, where appropriate.

Work with MarkPub to ensure that all of the above is done correctly, and
on-message with the rest of the community.

## Who

The WG shall create membership criteria that ensure that you're enabling
people who can responsibly, consistently, positively and coherently be
spokespeople for the ASF. Possibly work with MarkPub to establish some
kind of guidelines or certification?

## Outlets

* [Twitter/X - @apachecommunity](https://twitter.com/apachecommunity)
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ApacheSoftwareFoundation)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-apache-software-foundation/)
* Mastodon?

## ToDo

* Define what "channels" we will be posting content to
* Determine how we will do authentication/credential sharing, especially
  for social networks that don't have a concept of shared channel
  ownership.
* Content plan/process
    * Content acquisition and/or authoring
    * Amplification of other accounts (projects? ASF official? External
      groups?)
    * Process for people to submit content? Review and approval process.
    * Scheduling, so that it's not chaos
* Fix or replace birthday.pl tool (in
  https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/comdev/tools) which generates the
  list of project birthdays each month
* Process to work with MarkPub on producing and publishing content
