# Why we should build our community

## Summary

Apache Software Foundation often quoted theme is "Community over Code". This is because
we in the ASF believe that building community of people who are working together to build software for
the public good are better goal than the software they create. It's not more or less important, but we
believe that the community is what makes the software sustainable and what makes the software valuable
and what all but guarantees the software will be made "for the public good".

Communities can form at various levels, but in the most basic form in the ASF, they form around PMC
(Project Management Committee), It's important that even if the work, communication, leadership is
contributed by individuals, the end result is contributed to a community as a whole. The PMC structure
is generally flat (With `PMC members`, `committers` having formal role, privileges and duties, and everyone
being potentially a `contributor`. There are no managers, nor lines of reporting, nor concept of
"subordinates" in the ASF projects. Anyone can contribute in virtually any are and way they want, with
the PMC members and committers collectively overlooking the direction and daily operations of the project.

While particular changes - either in the code or the process or documentation or any other contributions
are made by individuals, the moment they get accepted, they become "community" thing. There are no "authors"
labels that stick to those contributions - other than historical track of the contributions that might help
to understand the context of the changes, but not to assign the "ownership" of the change. No single person
or company should "own" the software or its parts. It's not good if one entity has too much power over the
software, control the direction of the project or the way how community cooperates. While PMC members
obviously can (and often are) employed by various stakeholders, when making project decisions should make them
in the best interest of the project, not their employee. Where they perceive they have conflict of interest,
they should remove themselves from the decision making process.

A note about creators of the software - even if the software has been donated to the ASF and originally
created by a single person or a company, at the moment of graduation to be Top Level Project, the software
is "created" and maintained by the community, and we prefer to either not refer to, or refer to as the
"original creators" to the people and companies who donated the software to the ASF.

A healthy community is a community that is diverse, inclusive, and welcoming. It's a community that is
transparent, open, and honest. It's a community that is respectful, and that is able to resolve conflicts
in a constructive way. It's a community that is able to make decisions and to execute them. It's a community
that is able to grow and to adapt to the changing circumstances. It's a community that is able to attract
new contributors and to retain the existing ones. It's a community that is able to work together to achieve
common goals. One of the aspects of a healthy community is to make it easy for new contributors to start
contributing - via documentation, development environment, and mentorship.

Adding new contributors, committers and PMC members often with low barrier of entry, driven by the
community members and approved by a voting process defined in the ASF Voting rules, is an important
aspect of building a community.

Important thing to remember is that the community consists not only from contributors - but also the users. 
The users are those who are recipients of the software. They are the ones who are using the software, who
are reporting issues, who are asking questions, who are suggesting improvements. They are the ones who are
providing feedback, who are providing support, who are providing advocacy. They are the ones who are helping
to make the software better. That's why it's important to build a community that is not only inclusive and
welcoming to contributors, but also to users and helps them to answer their questions, respond to issues,
reviews Pull Requests.

## Why are we doing it?

Because we believe that building a community is a prerequisite and necessary requirement to release a software
for public good. The community is what makes the software sustainable, valuable, and what all but guarantees
the software will be made "for the public good".

## Is it mandatory and what are conditions?

Yes, building and maintaining the community is what make the ASF projects "active". This is one of the
most important sign of an active and healthy project, that the community around continuously evolves,
new contributors are added, and the project is able to attract both users and contributors. Therefore
we consider building and maintaining the community as a mandatory part of the project.

## Are there variations for different projects?

There are certain variations of the community building process that the PMC can adopt - various PMCs
decided to have different rules on what the committers and PMC members can make decisions on, but generally
speaking it's expected all PMCs follow the general directions and principles described above.
