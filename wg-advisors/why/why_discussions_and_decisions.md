# Why discussion and decision-making had to happen on the mailing list

## Summary 

Discussions and decision-making should happen on the mailing list to ensure that the project is
transparent and that all decisions are made in the open. This is important to ensure that all
community members have the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process.

## Why are we doing it?

In short: because of inclusivity, asynchronous communication need, transparency and the ability to
preserve the record of the discussions and decisions.

Mailing list the primary communication channel for the project. It has been chosen - at the dawn of the
Foundation as the primary communication channel because it was the most inclusive and accessible channel
for all community members, allowing for asynchronous communication and ensuring that all community members
have the opportunity to participate. All the important decisions and discussions happens there - including
the decision to invite new committers and PMC members, the decisions to release software, and the decisions
to change the project's direction.

Why the time passed and technology evolved, the mailing list still keep a lot of the properties that made it
the primary communication channel for the project. It is still the most inclusive and accessible channel for
all community members, they allow for asynchronous communication and do not require from the community members
to be online at the same time and to create accounts with particular external services.

Email is ubiquitous and while not loved by everyone , it has the advantage that you can choose
the mail clients of your choice, with the features that you like, or even choose a webmail client,
usually those clients allow you to easily categorise and search the emails, and it's easier to keep track
of conversations even if you are offline for some time or in a different time zone. The information density
comparing to online chat is usually higher, so it is a good medium to record decisions and discussions
about them.

It's very hard to get all those properties in other communication channels and get to agree between all
the community members to use the same one, while not the best for everyone, it's likely the best as the
common denominator among the tools and channels you can use.

It is important to stress that we also want to keep a permanent record of the discussions and decisions and
the Apache Software Foundation Infrastructure team makes sure that the archives are preserved and available
for the future, including the ability to search and browse the archives, as well as permanently
link to the discussions and decisions so that they can be always referred to in the future.

The communication on mailing list happens in English, which is the language of the Foundation,
and the language of the majority of the Foundation's community members. 

An important aspect of using the mailing list is that it allows anyone (including PMC members, committers,
contributors, and users, but also people from outside - Board members, other PMCs, non-ASF folks) to take
a look at the way how decisions are made and even participate in the discussions and decisions, and to
peek into the PMC status. This is important for the Foundation's transparency and for the community building
process.

PMCs have at least two lists: dev@ and private@ - but it is important to mention that the private@ list should
only be used for discussions that are absolutely not suitable for public consumption, such as discussions
about security vulnerabilities, or discussions about individuals that are not suitable for public consumption
and should be kept private. The private@ list should not be used for discussions about the project's direction,
voting, releases (except voting and releasing the releases with critical security issue fixes). No project
decisions should be made on the private@ list in general.

## Is it mandatory and what are conditions?

Yes, it is mandatory for all ASF projects to have their important discussions and decisions on the mailing
list, and for many (especially not extremely active) project it might be the only communication method.
However - and this is described in the following chapter, there are some exceptions and variations.

It is important that the mailing lists of the projects are not flooded with non-important communication, that
makes is difficult to follow the important discussions and decisions. The PMC members should actively work
on making sure that the mailing list has a high signal-to-noise ratio, and that the important discussions
and decisions are not drowned in the noise. This is especially important for projects that have a lot of
activity and a lot of changes being discussed in parallel.

On the other hand, too little activity on the mailing list might be a red flag, indicating that the project
is not transparent and that the community members are not participating in the decision-making process.

## Are there variations for different projects?

With a big number of various communication tools and channels available, and the fact that a lot of them
are suitable in different contexts (GitHub Issues, PRs, Discussions) and with different speed of interactions,
some of them being more or less instantaneous, and the PMC might be ok and endorse use of some of the other
media, but they should be aware that they take on the responsibility to guide and direct people to the mailing
list when the discussions and decisions are important and should be made in the open and with participation
of the whole community. This is especially important with projects that have a lot of activity and a lot of
changes being discussed in parallel - where those changes and discussions have various level of importance
and impact on the project and the community. Many projects use various communication media, GitHub Issues,
PRs, Discussions, Slack, JIRA, Discord, etc. for various purposes and in various context.

As long as the PMC members are aware of the importance of the mailing list, and they actively guide and direct
people to the mailing list when the discussions and decisions - and explain why, and as long as all the
important decisions and discussions are happening on the mailing list, the PMC is doing the right thing.
