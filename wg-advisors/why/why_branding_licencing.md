# Why we should look after the project's brand and licencing

## Summary

The Apache Software Foundation's most important asset is a combination of branding and license that is
used by all Apache projects. The license is the Apache License, Version 2.0, and the branding is based
on the project name. The licence is a permissive open source license that allows the software to be used
by anyone for any purpose, and the branding is a set of rules that ensure that the software is recognized
as an Apache project and that the project is recognized as part of the Apache Software Foundation. While
we allow anyone to use the software, and redistribute it, we do not allow anyone to claim that they are
the "owners" of the software, or that they are controlling the project.

This is why it is important to ensure that the project's brand is not used in a way that could cause confusion
or mislead users on who is owning or controlling the project. This includes ensuring that the project's name
is not used in a way that could imply that another party is controlling the project - assuring
vendor neutrality. More about it in [Project Independence](https://community.apache.org/projectIndependence.html)

Some, popular, Apache projects have a strong brand recognition, and it's important to ensure that the
brand is used consistently across all project's assets, including the website, documentation, and
marketing materials and the ASF registers the project's name as a trademark to ensure that the project's
brand is protected.

The ASF has a set of policies that define how the Apache brand should be used, and it's important that
all projects follow these guidelines to ensure that the brand is used consistently and correctly.

It's a PMC responsibility to ensure that the project's brand is used correctly and to take action if the
brand is used in a way that could cause confusion or mislead users.

The foundation has legal ways to enforce the brand and license, but it's always better to resolve any
issues informally, by contacting the party that is using the brand incorrectly and asking them to correct
the issue.

Events are a special case, as they are often organized by third parties, and it's important to ensure
that the event is recognized as an Apache event and that the event is organized in a way that is consistent
with the Apache Software Foundation's values and principles.

## Why are we doing it?

We are doing it, because with the open licence that allows anyone to use and redistribute the software we
release for public good, having control over the brand is the most important
way how the ASF can ensure that vendor neutrality is maintained, and that the project is recognized
as part of the Apache Software Foundation. The brand is what makes the project recognizable, and it protects
from 3rd parties trying to take control over the project, ultimately this is the only way how the ASF can
ensure that the project is not taken over by another entity that claims to be the "owner" of the project.

## Is it mandatory and what are conditions?

Yes, it is mandatory to ensure that the project's brand is used correctly and that the project's license
and branding is respected. This is the most important responsibility of the PMC, and it's important that
the PMC takes this responsibility seriously.

## Are there variations for different projects?

Not really. Properly using of ASF brand is a must for all projects.
