# Code Of Conduct Working Group

To provide a recommended (not required) template for project code of
conduct.

## Status

In process

## What

This group will create a template, based on the Contributor Covenant,
that projects can adopt verbatim, or customize for their needs, as a
project code of conduct.

## What it is *not*

Reminder: ComDev is a PMC, not a board committee or a president's
committee. It is advisory, and has no power.

As such, we are NOT mandating a code of conduct for projects. We are
merely trying to smooth the path to getting to one that reflects ASF
values, if a project wishes to do so.

In particular, this is NOT an effort to create a committee that would
impose and/or enforce community of codes on various projects, or at
the Foundation level. Any effort to turn it into that will 
be â€¦ unpopular. To say the least.

## To Do

Proposal:

The Code of Conduct working group will be a outcome-focused[1] effort to start with the Contributor Covenant V 2.1 [2] and turn it into a template which ASF project could adopt as-is, or make small tweaks to for their specific project. This task consists of several steps:

0) Create a section under https://github.com/apache/comdev-working-groups [DONE]

1) Edit the CCv2.1 to put ASF-specific language in (PMC, Project, Board, etc) [STARTED]

2) Identify sections that need to be updated/altered to reflect the ASF way of doing things. Eg, Clarify the Scope section for ASF norms, and work out the escalation path for when/if a project wishes to escalate a complaint to the Foundation. (Which would require understanding and working with the existing process, so that we are not creating new work for the folks that already do that work.) [STARTED]

3) Run it by a few projects and see what they think

4) Provide it as a template on community.apache.org as a proposed/suggested template.

5) Consider how to get projects and podlings to adopt their own Code of Conduct, once the default has been reviewed. Perhaps:
   a) notify all PMCs that the new default is available and encourage them to adopt it or write their own
   b) add adoption of Code of Conduct to podling Maturity Model
   

## Notes

[1] By outcome-focused, what I mean is that it has a specific task, which, upon completion, the WG would dissolve
